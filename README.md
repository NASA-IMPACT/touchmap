# Touch-Table-Visualization
## Project overview:
This file describes developing a web application that displays a map of the United States divided into four map instances. Each map instance is independent of the other (while we clicked on one map instance, the other map instances should not be changed). Also, the application allows users to choose what data to display on the map from Veda data.
